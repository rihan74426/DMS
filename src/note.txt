    2. tailwind css
    3. functions
    4. emitting and data
    5. gpt code unchecked

    10. error updating and deleting data. 
    11. the url setup got some errors
    12. user duplicate username error: solved by installing the DB compass and deleting the collection
    13. having error in SSR. the components does not renders automatically. solution worked to do the conditions on the root app.vue
    13. the tailwind text hovering expanding was simpler than the dynamic script of Read more button.
    14. showing products, updating as per actions and then the realtime search option was made by me with very dificulties.
    15. The username showing in the navbar is troubling because of maybe the store doesn't respond sooner. 
    also had to cancel the profile pic show on the navbar. because the data could not be fetched earlier and showing failures.
    16. The transaction page setup kind of challenging cuz there we had to take the company and products also backend was hassle. 
    17. and also the pdf generator was kind of challenging. it was hard coding every space and lines. But feels wonderful when it all works :).
    18. lastly the user page and the updating and adding the image was an issue but fixed it by rearranging the backend.
    19. As a close teacher more like brother instructed me after seeing the app. So I made some changes in the images of the products to fit them in a size.
    It did not done easily but I've solved it somehow. then, the edit and delete button also asked to made to icons for more professionalism. Yeah I've done it also
